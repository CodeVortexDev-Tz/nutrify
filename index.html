    <h1>Nutrify: take a photo of food and learn about it.</h1>
    <p>Work in progress.</p>
    <p>Nutrify's goal is to enable you to take a photo of what you're eating, about to eat or food you see in a store
        and learn about it.</p>
    <p>That could mean calories, nutrients, where the food comes, what it goes with, how long its been around for, where
        it's native, etc.</p>
    <p>To start, we're keeping it simple. Whole foods only. For example, an onion or a banana rather than a dish like
        chicken curry.</p>
    <p>You can try the current model to identify foods now. It works for <a
            href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/nutrify/main/classes.txt">100 foods</a> so far.</p>
    <button id="upload-button">
        <span>Upload Image</span>
    </button>
    <p>
        <input type="file" style="display: none" accept="image/*" name="image" id="file-input" />
    </p>
    <p><img id="image" width="200" /></p>

    <p>Predicted class:</p>
    <p id="predicted_class"></p>
    <!-- <p>Predicted probability:</p>
    <p id="predicted_prob"></p> -->
    <p>Building the vision models will likely take a fair amount of labelled images of food (currently being sourced).
    </p>
    <p>But if you'd like to help, you can <a
            href="https://share.streamlit.io/mrdbourke/nutrify/main/food_image_collector.py">upload an image of
            food</a>.</p>
    <p>See the <a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/nutrify">GitHub</a> for development stages and code.</p>
    <p>Watch the live development on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mrdbourke">Twitch</a> and <a
